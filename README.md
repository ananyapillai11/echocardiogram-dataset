# Echocardiogram Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for analyzing and visualizing echocardiogram data. The goal is to provide insights into cardiac health by processing and interpreting echocardiographic measurements.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing raw echocardiogram data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying critical parameters related to cardiac function.
- **Visualization**: Plotting and analyzing key metrics for better interpretation.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Deriving meaningful insights from echocardiographic data.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echocardiogram-analysis.git
   cd echocardiogram-analysis
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ECHOCARDIOGRAM.ipynb

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook cells to preprocess data, run analyses, and generate visualizations.
3. Replace the placeholder data with your own echocardiogram dataset for personalized insights.

## Dataset
This project requires echocardiogram data in a CSV format. The dataset should include measurements such as:

-Left ventricular dimensions.
-Wall thickness.
-Ejection fraction.
-Doppler parameters.
-Ensure data is formatted correctly before running the analysis.

## Results
-Plots highlighting key cardiac measurements.
-Statistical summaries and correlations.
-Interactive visualizations for in-depth exploration.
